# Cynt — AI-Powered Startup Due Diligence System

> **Cynt** is a full-stack platform that automates startup investment due diligence using a multi-agent AI pipeline. Entrepreneurs submit their documents; investors receive structured analysis, scores, and a go/no-go recommendation — all in minutes.

---

## Overview

Cynt is a **B2B investment intelligence platform** that connects entrepreneurs and investors. The core value proposition is a **4-stage async AI pipeline** that:

1. Extracts structured data from raw documents (PDFs, CSVs/XLSX).
2. Runs deterministic financial and market simulations.
3. Scores the startup across three dimensions using LLM-powered agents.
4. Synthesises a final investment recommendation and a plain-text investment memo.

**Two user roles** exist:
- **Entrepreneurs** — upload pitch deck, financials, and founder profile, select and apply to investors, receive emails for decisions.
- **Investors** — review applications, trigger AI analysis, accept/reject startups, and invite other investors to collaborate.

---

## Key Features
- Multi-agent AI pipeline for automated startup due diligence
- Document ingestion from pitch decks, financial spreadsheets, and founder profiles
- Deterministic financial simulations and market signal analysis
- AI-generated investment memo with structured risk analysis
- Collaboration workflow enabling multiple investors to evaluate the same startup
- Automated email notifications informing entrepreneurs when applications are **approved or rejected**, including the **investor decision and message**

## Core Modules
**Document Processor**  
Extracts structured startup data from pitch decks, financial spreadsheets, and founder profiles.
**Financial Simulation Engine**  
Computes financial health metrics such as runway, burn efficiency, dilution, and capital efficiency.
**Market Signal Connector**  
Fetches external market signals from Google Trends and news activity to estimate market momentum.
**Memo Generator**  
Produces a structured investment memo summarizing analysis results and risks.
**Pipeline Orchestrator**  
Coordinates the full asynchronous analysis pipeline and aggregates agent outputs.

---

## AI Agents
All agents use `langchain_groq.ChatGroq` with `temperature=0` (deterministic), `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. They receive a structured system prompt + a tightly-formatted human message and return a **JSON object only**.
There are three specialized AI agents:
- Financial Risk Agent – evaluates burn rate, runway, and valuation realism.
- Market Validation Agent – analyzes market demand signals and competitive saturation.
- Founder Intelligence Agent – evaluates founder experience, network strength, and execution credibility.
A final decision engine aggregates the agent scores using deterministic weighting and generates the final investment recommendation.

---

## Frontend
Built with **React 19 + Vite 7**. Single-page app served from FastAPI's static file mount in production.

### App Routing (`App.jsx`)
```
App
├── (no user)  → LoginPage
├── (entrepreneur) → EntrepreneurDashboard
└── (investor) → InvestorDashboard
```

Role is set from the login API response and stored in React state.

API base URL auto-detects environment: Vite dev server (port 5170–5180) → `localhost:8000`; production → `window.location.origin`.

---

### Entrepreneur Flow
**Dashboard**
Entrepreneurs can view and manage all of their submitted applications. The dashboard displays:
- Company name
- Target investor
- Application status
- Submission date

**Apply to Investor**
The **"Apply to Investor"** button opens a submission wizard:
**Upload required files and startup details:**
  - Pitch deck (PDF)
  - Financials (CSV/XLSX)
  - Founder profile (PDF)
  - Company name
  - Founder LinkedIn URL
  - Target investor(s)

**Application Status**
Applications appear in the dashboard with one of the following statuses:
- `Pending`
- `Analyzed`
- `Accepted`
- `Rejected`

Entrepreneurs also receive **email notifications from Cynt** when investors approve or reject their application.

---

### Investor Flow
Investors review incoming startup applications and perform AI-powered due diligence.
The **Investor Dashboard** contains three primary tabs.

#### Applications
Displays all startups submitted directly to the investor as well as applications shared through collaboration.
For each application, investors can:
- View uploaded documents
- Trigger the **AI analysis pipeline**
- Review the full **analysis results**, including:
  - Score dashboard (visual cards + Recharts chart)
  - Financial simulation results
  - Market signal analysis
  - Founder assessment
  - Final investment decision
  - Generated investment memo

Results can also be exported as a **PDF report**.

Investors may then:
- **Accept** or **Reject** the startup (with an optional message to the entrepreneur)
- **Invite other investors** to collaborate on the evaluation
- View a **deal summary** showing all participating investors and collaboration activity.

#### Invites
Shows all **pending collaboration invites** received from other investors.
Invited investors must first **run their own AI assessment** before deciding whether to join the collaboration.
They can then:
- Accept the collaboration
- Reject the collaboration

#### Collaboration Hub
Displays all **decided collaboration invitations** (both sent and received), including:
- Accepted collaborations
- Rejected invitations
- Which investor invited whom
- The final collaboration outcome

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# LLM
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true
DB_NAME=data                              # For LinkedIn indicator collection
COLLECTION_NAME=indicator                 # For LinkedIn indicator collection
# Market signals
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key             # newsapi.org
# LinkedIn (optional — activates live scraping)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
RAPIDAPI_HOST=fresh-linkedin-scraper-api.p.rapidapi.com
# Email notifications (optional)
SMTP_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com                  # default
SMTP_PORT=587                             # default
# Server (set by Docker/HF Spaces)
PORT=7860                                 # defaults to 8000 locally
```
**Minimum required**: `GROQ_API_KEY` + `MONGO_URI`
**Optional services** (system degrades gracefully):
- `NEWS_API_KEY` — market signals fall back to 50.0 neutral score
- `RAPIDAPI_KEY` — LinkedIn live scrape skipped (falls back to document text)
- `SMTP_EMAIL` + `SMTP_PASSWORD` — email notifications skipped silently

---

## Running Locally
### Backend
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Copy and fill in environment variables
cp .env.example .env  # or create .env manually
# Run the FastAPI server (with auto-reload in local mode)
python main.py
# → http://localhost:8000
# → API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Frontend (Dev Server)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

In dev mode, `api.js` automatically proxies to `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## Docker / Deployment
### Multi-Stage Build
The Dockerfile uses a two-stage build:
**Stage 1 (Node 20 Alpine):** Installs frontend deps, runs `npm run build`, produces `frontend/dist`.
**Stage 2 (Python 3.11 slim):**
- Installs `gcc`, `libffi-dev` for native Python deps.
- Installs Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
- Copies Python source (`main.py`, `api/`, `agents/`, `core/`, `utils/`).
- Copies built frontend from Stage 1 into `frontend/dist`.
- Sets `PORT=7860` (HuggingFace Spaces convention).
- Runs `python main.py`.
FastAPI serves the React SPA by mounting the `frontend/dist` folder at `/`:
```python
app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="frontend/dist", html=True), name="frontend")
```

### Build and Run
```bash
docker build -t cynt .
docker run -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env cynt
# → http://localhost:7860
```
